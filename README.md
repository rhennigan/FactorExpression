# OptimizationToolkit for Mathematica

Disclaimer: Expect everything to break often.

* Wear safety goggles when handling recursive `DownValues`
* Take note of the location of the nearest exit before attempting to auto-optimize functions
* Look both ways before setting `$RecursionLimit` to `Infinity`
* In the event of a kernel crash, duck and cover

See `Example.nb` for usage examples.
